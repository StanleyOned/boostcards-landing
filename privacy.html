        <p class="subtitle">How StudySpark protects your data and privacy</p>
        <p class="date">Last updated: August 30, 2025</p>

        <section>
          <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
          <p>StudySpark collects minimal information to provide our AI-powered flashcard service. We collect study content including text, images, PDFs, and voice recordings that you upload to generate flashcards. Additionally, we gather usage data such as study sessions, progress tracking, and app analytics to improve your learning experience.</p>
          <p>We also collect basic device information including your iOS version and device type for app optimization purposes. All data collection is focused solely on enhancing your learning experience and maintaining app functionality.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>How We Use Your Information</h2>
          <p>Your information is used exclusively to provide and improve our flashcard learning service. We process your study materials through AI technology to generate personalized flashcards that enhance your learning experience. Your flashcards are synchronized and backed up through Apple's CloudKit integration, ensuring your study progress is preserved across all your Apple devices.</p>
          <p>We analyze your learning patterns and study sessions to optimize our spaced repetition algorithms, helping you learn more effectively. Usage data is also utilized to enhance app features and performance, ensuring StudySpark continues to meet your educational needs.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>Data Storage & Security</h2>
          <p>Your data security is our highest priority. Your flashcards are stored securely in Apple's CloudKit infrastructure with end-to-end encryption, ensuring that only you can access your study materials. When generating flashcards, your content is processed securely through OpenAI's services and is not stored permanently by third-party providers.</p>
          <p>Voice recordings and images are processed locally on your device whenever possible, minimizing data transmission. We maintain strict data protection standards and never sell or share your personal study content with third parties under any circumstances.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>Voice & Image Processing</h2>
          <p>StudySpark prioritizes your privacy by processing voice and image content locally whenever possible. Speech recognition utilizes Apple's on-device Speech framework, while image processing leverages Apple's Vision framework to extract text directly on your device. PDF text extraction is also performed locally using Apple's native frameworks.</p>
          <p>Audio recordings are temporarily processed for text conversion and are immediately deleted once transcription is complete. This approach minimizes data transmission and ensures your personal content remains private throughout the learning process.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>Your Data Rights</h2>
          <p>You maintain complete control over your data within StudySpark. You can delete individual flashcards or entire study sets at any time through the app interface. All data associated with deleted study sets is permanently removed from both your device and Apple's CloudKit storage.</p>
          <p>You have the right to export your study materials and can disable analytics or AI features through the app settings. Since StudySpark operates without traditional user accounts, your data is tied directly to your Apple ID through CloudKit, providing seamless integration while maintaining your privacy.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
          <p>StudySpark integrates with carefully selected, trusted services to provide our core functionality. OpenAI powers our AI flashcard generation capabilities, processing your content securely without permanent storage. Apple CloudKit provides secure data synchronization across your Apple devices with industry-leading encryption standards.</p>
          <p>The App Store handles all subscription billing and management, ensuring secure payment processing through Apple's established infrastructure. These integrations are essential for app functionality while maintaining the highest security and privacy standards.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
          <p>StudySpark is designed to be safe and appropriate for learners of all ages. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13 years of age. If we become aware that we have collected personal information from a child under 13, we will take immediate steps to delete such information.</p>
          <p>Parents and guardians have full control over their child's study data and can review or delete any information at any time through the app interface. We encourage parents to discuss online privacy and safe app usage with their children.</p>
